It was a Grade 2 ACL and Grade 1 Lateral Collateral Ligament injury. I didn’t go for surgery because I was scared it would cause more problems, so I relied completely on rehab. It worked for some time, but not for long, and I got injured again. I was honestly on the verge of giving up when I met Mr. Swatheeshwaran sir.\n\nMost physios will just say “eat this and do this exercise,” but he analysed everything — even small things like my sleeping pattern and eating habits — and everything he said actually made sense. That’s when I realised the minor things I ignored were bringing the biggest impact.\n\nHe started monitoring my improvements, my diet plan and the entire rehab process, and within just two months I saw massive improvement in my health and physique. Because of him, I was able to get up and play my favourite sport again. And the impact is still there.\n\nHe’s the one who made me understand what the word “proper diet” really means, and I’m still following it to stay healthy. I’m really thankful that he always made sure I improved. He never hesitated to help, always made time to interact with me and go through my progress.\n\nThank you for your wonderful efforts and insights, sir.",

I got confidence the moment I spoke with him. He understood my pain and my condition right away, analysed everything clearly and explained it to me in a way that made complete sense. I gained confidence through that and started attending regular rehab under his advice.\n\nAfter 2 years of struggling with pain, I finally got out of pain in just 1 month of physio sessions with sir. Until now, I’m functioning without pain or re-injury by following the advice he gave me. I’m still continuing the exercises he taught me. He also taught me how to prepare before games to avoid re-injury and how to warm up properly. I still follow those protocols in my routine.\n\nI’m really grateful for the help he gave me, because I had completely lost hope until I met him.",
