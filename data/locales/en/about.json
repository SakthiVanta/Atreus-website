        "bio": "I'm Swatheeshwaran, and I started ATREUS PHYSIO because I wanted to create something different—a clinic where patients don't just get treated, but truly understand what's happening in their bodies. My journey began in sports physiotherapy, where I learned that recovery is as much about mindset as it is about exercises. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with everyone from professional athletes to people dealing with everyday aches and pains, and each person has taught me something new about resilience and healing.",
        "experience": "I spent three years as an Assistant Professor, which shaped how I communicate complex medical concepts in ways that actually make sense. Teaching forced me to think from the student's perspective, and I carry that same approach into patient care today. I've also been fortunate to work on the sidelines of major sporting events—national championships, state tournaments, and university competitions—where split-second decisions and rapid recovery protocols are part of the job. Those high-pressure environments taught me to stay calm, think clearly, and always put the athlete's long-term health first.",

        "approach": "I believe rehabilitation works best when it feels like a partnership, not a prescription. My approach starts with asking questions and really listening to your answers. From there, we build a plan that's grounded in evidence but flexible enough to adapt as you progress. I focus on movement quality, gradual strength building, and helping you understand why each exercise matters. The goal isn't just to make the pain go away—it's to give you the tools and confidence to prevent it from coming back. Every session, we're working together toward you being able to move, play, and live exactly how you want to."

People wanted to understand their pain, not just mask it. They wanted to be partners in their recovery, not passive recipients. That's why we built ATREUS PHYSIO—a place where evidence-based care meets clear communication, and where every treatment plan is designed around your life, not a textbook."

Then we create a plan that actually makes sense—one that fits your schedule, your goals, and your body. Whether you're recovering from surgery, dealing with chronic pain, or training for your next marathon, we'll work with you to build strength, restore movement, and get you back to doing what you love."

Rehabilitation is a journey we take together."
